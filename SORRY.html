        <p>Darling, this is for you ðŸ’–</p>
        <p>
          No matter what, I will always try to give you the best version of myself. Please don't get tired of teaching me & guiding me, because I always want to learn to go through many good/bad days with you so that we can survive. This is me with my best version along with all my shortcomings to decorate it.

          I'm sorry for making you tired during this relationship with me and I also want to say thank you all this time for your never-ending patience, even though my character and attitude often make you dizzy or even tired hehe.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know it must be really hard for you :')) thank you for still holding on and putting up with me, even though there is still a lot you can get that is more than me, thank you for your time, feelings, energy, who are still sincere and willing to love me, despite my many shortcomings, still want to accept me, I want to invite you to make a fuss with me, but I'm not ready if you leave me hehe sounds selfish, right darling? :))
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't want to expect much, but I want us to be both strong, so we can carry on this relationship, whatever happens, never leave each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          you remember my message, I love you and don't want to leave you, do you know, I'm typing it like this now but the sound is very annoying hehe I don't know what's on my mind right now
        </p>
        <p>
        I feel like I don't know any manners, I just want to say that you are a little different, hehe, that's normal dear, maybe that's my attitude, hehe, but there's still a lot that's the same in your attitude.
        </p>

      <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 5)">
        <p>
         I don't know, I can't explain it in more detail, sorry, I know, sometimes I'm not the best in your eyes. I'm just still a burden on my parents and grew up full of the wounds I got hehe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm afraid of being happy, but I really want to be happy. I don't know if my attitude is impolite, I just want to say that you are a little different, hehe, that's normal, darling, maybe that's my attitude, hehe, but there's still a lot of the same in your attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know darling, I don't know how to hope anymore, I don't want to hope too much, you still want to accept me, thank God, if not, tell me from now on, darling, so I can know myself hehe I feel so much wrong with you that I think I can't respond to kindness. I love you so much I love you so much.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't know whether I'll be able to do it or not if you leave me hehe. There's nothing I can be proud of about myself, let alone my family:'))

          I'm sorry, I'm too selfish, I often get angry at you and sometimes I ignore you just because I'm jealous and misunderstand. We often fight, I don't know why now, I get emotional, so I get jealous easily because of small things. Maybe my love for you is too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm just afraid of you leaving, I'm afraid you'll get bored with me just because of my unclear attitude, I'm afraid you'll be bored until you end up asking to separate. I'm afraid of everything I'm afraid of happening. I'm sorry for always thinking about my own ego, without thinking about your feelings. I beg you, don't leave me, I'm not ready to lose you, don't ever get bored.
        </p>
        <p>
          IF you're bored, don't think about ending it all. We fight!!!, Boredom is only temporary, don't just choose to leave me because you're bored. Lately I've been incuring a lot, I don't know why I feel like I'm coming back, I feel like I'm not worthy of anyone.

        <p>
          I know you're so tired of hearing me apologize, but I told you something, right? it's better to apologize than to lose you, you are my world.
        </p>
        <p>My world is small and quiet too, because the only inhabitant is you, I hope you understand some of the things I said above, I also want us to continue to be good, I love you, I really love you, nothing has changed about me, I always love you. , you are my favorite person</p>

        <h2>Now you forgive me?</h2>
